<h1>Application Cache with manifest file</h1>

<p>This test page includes a manifest file, which explicitly loads the page itself, the associated JavaScript and the general stylesheet into the browser's application cache. Once loaded for the first time, you can try disconnecting your machine from the network, emptying your regular cache, and reloading the page...it should still display offline.</p>

<p id="online"><strong>For demonstration purposes, the page's manifest also specifies a stylesheet that is only available from the network and turns this paragraph dark grey with white text. Once offline, with an empty regular cache, this stylesheet will not be loaded, and this paragraph will be red with white text.</strong></p>

<div><img src="images/keep-calm.jpg" alt="Image specified with application cache manifest"><img src="images/blue-sign.jpg" alt="Image which will be switched with fallback image once offline"></div>

<p>Lastly, the manifest lists the image here on the left to be cached. The other image won't be available when offline, but because of the <code>FALLBACK</code> specified for any files in the <code>images/</code> location, it will instead be replaced with a placeholder (which, for this reason, is also cached automatically).</p>

<h2><code>window.applicationCache</code> events</h2>

<p>To illustrate the various event handlers associated with the <code>window.applicationCache</code> object, this message window shows what's happening behind the scenes. You'll notice that the first time this page loads, the various resources referenced in the manifest are downloaded. On subsequent loads (even when offline), these are pulled directly from the application cache.</p>
